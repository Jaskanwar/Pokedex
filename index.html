        <p>
            It is recognized as a symbol of longevity. If its shell has algae on it, that Wartortle is very old.

            It is waiting for the moment to evolve. At this stage, it can only harden,
            so it remains motionless to avoid attack.

            Very docile. If attacked, it will often kick up sand to protect itself rather than fight back.
